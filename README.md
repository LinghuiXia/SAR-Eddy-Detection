# Clarification on the SAR-Eddy 2019 Dataset:
The dataset was publicly available prior to June 2024. However, it has since been incorporated into a confidential project, and we are now bound by a confidentiality agreement. As a result, we are no longer permitted to share the dataset or any related files in any form, and all previously available download links have been deactivated.

If access to the dataset is required, we recommend contacting the authors who cited the original publication before June 2024 or in early 2025 to inquire whether they obtained a copy during the public release period.

For questions related to dataset construction or processing methods, please feel free to contact the first author directly. The E-Mail: xialinghui007@163.com.

Thanks!
